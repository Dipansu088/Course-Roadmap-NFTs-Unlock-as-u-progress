# Course Roadmap NFTs – Unlock as You Progress

## 🧾 Project Description

*Course Roadmap NFTs* is a smart contract built using the Clarity language on the Stacks blockchain. It aims to reward learners with unique NFTs as they complete different stages of an online course. Students unlock these collectible tokens as proof of progress and achievement.

## 🌟 Project Vision

To build an on-chain verifiable system of educational progress where:
- NFTs represent milestones in a student's learning journey
- Smart contracts govern NFT eligibility based on progress
- Learning becomes more gamified, engaging, and rewarding

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Add metadata for each NFT level with design, title, and course name
- Support for multiple courses and modules
- A frontend interface where students can track progress and claim NFTs
- Integration with decentralized identities (DIDs)
- Add NFT transfer restrictions or trading features
